Notes and code taken during watching [O'Reilly The Complete Java Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-complete-java/9781801075190/)

## First observations
**22nd March 2023**
I am not a fan of Java... it's needed for my work projects though

When watching the second section of the course there's first difficult question:
- *Which version of which Java should I install?*
The answer come, as usual, when I was away from the computer:
install the version that is used in the course - jdk-14.0.1 - maybe just take the last version of jdk-14
Once done with the course one would need to start jumping through the release notes of Oracle to learn what's new on upper versions:
![JDK version from the course](/assets/jdk14.PNG "JDK version from the course")
Or find some documentation on how to do stuff on earlier versions of Java for already existing projects.
Let's see if my patience grow up to such a point. I already feel a scratch of annoyance in my brain for learning this language.
Ok, so Java 14 is already on [Oracle archive](https://www.oracle.com/pl/java/technologies/javase/jdk14-archive-downloads.html)
And I need to create an account...
